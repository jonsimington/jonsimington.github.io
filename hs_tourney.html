      <li>
        If interested, reply to the reddit post with your battletag, and I will enter you as a competitor.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        After a week or so of open registrations, I will schedule everyone for a match with another redditor.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        a) You will have one week (maybe 2 if enough people request it) per round to complete your 5-game match with the person you are assigned. The time of your match will be decided upon between you and the person you will be matched up against.
        <br>
        <br>
        b) If one of the two players is a no-show for a match, and it is documented that one person showed more effort to complete the match, the person who exhibited more effort will receive three (3) game points, and one (1) match point.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Each match will be a best of 5 games, with the rule that you come prepared with 3 decks / heroes. If you win a game, you keep playing that deck, but if you lose, you choose a new deck / hero from your set of three.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Once a match (best of five games) has been completed, the WINNER will send me a reddit message with the score of the match (e.g. The match between Oss and Qoof ended with a score of 3-1, Oss winning 3 of the games (Qoof sucks <3)).
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        At the end of each round, I will compile the results, and post them at /hs_bracket/. In addition to having the bracket visible to all, I will post some simple win / loss statistics for all competitors at /hs_stats/.
      </li>
